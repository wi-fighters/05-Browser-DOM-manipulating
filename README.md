# The Book List
Create a personalized book website! Instead of adding all of the details of books in HTML, add data on the page from the array below using JavaScript.

**Instructions**:
* Iterate through the array of books and display the title and author on the page.
* Add an image to each book that links to a URL of the book cover.
* Add bootstrap classes to the elements where necessary in order to style the page - see images for styling reference. 
* Change the badge of the book depending on whether it has been read. Change the status paragraph to "Read".  
* Change the order of the author's name on the page. The last name should appear first e.g. "Smith John". 
* The books should appear in alphabetical order of the authors' last names on the page.

**Notes**: 
* Deadline: 2hrs.
* Work on the `index.html` and `index.js` files provided in this repository.
* Add bootstrap styling where necessary. See the reference images for result.
